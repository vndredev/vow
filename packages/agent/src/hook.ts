/**
 * The provider-neutral tool-call guardrail — the LLM HOOK's brain. A coding agent (Claude Code, Codex,
 * Gemini) about to run a tool hits its provider's pre-tool hook, which shells `vow hook <provider>`; this
 * decides ALLOW or DENY and, on DENY, returns the LLM-friendly reason naming the right vow path. So a wrong
 * action — a raw `gh pr create`, a direct push to main, `vp check --fix` — is BLOCKED in the moment with the
 * correction, not caught later by a red CI gate, and not left to a memory the next user's LLM never read.
 *
 * The rules + the verdict are provider-NEUTRAL (one engine for every provider). Each provider's hook
 * input/output JSON is a thin adapter; the Claude Code adapter lives here, the next ones join beside it.
